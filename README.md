# TxtLab/ Folkeeventyr og -viser

### ℹ ABOUT

The purpose of this very crude webapp is to enable students (in highschool L1-teaching) to work computationally and algorithmically with the (textual) analysis of Danish folktales, underguirded theoretically by the work of Vladimir Propp, Greimas, etc. Students' ways of using the webapp is part of ongoing research conducted by the Department of Computer Science / Department of Science Teaching at the University of Copenhagen.

If you are interested in learning more about the project, or if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out: `mosh (at) di.ku.dk`.

### ‼️ DISCLAIMER

- Texts (i.e., the specific folktales) are still hard-coded at this point.
- Have in mind that `form-signals` are added to nodes/states sequentially.
- The `Markov-tabel`-section (with its probabilities) is not serving any purpose atm.
