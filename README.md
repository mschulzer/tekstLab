# TxtLab/ Folkeeventyr og -viser

### ABOUT THE PROJECT

The purpose of this rather simple webapp is to enable students (in highschool L1-teaching) to work computationally and algorithmically with the (textual) analysis of Danish folktales, and in ways very much inspired theoretically by the work of like Propp, Greimas, etc. Students' ways of using the webapp is part of ongoing research conducted on behalf of the Department of Computer Science / Department of Science Teaching at the University of Copenhagen.
