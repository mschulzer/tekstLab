# TxtLab/ Folkeeventyr og -viser

### ABOUT THE PROJECT

The purpose of this rather simple webapp is to enable students (in L1) to work computationally/algorithmically with the analysis of folktales, but in ways underpinned theoretically by the work of early Formalists like Propp, Greimas, etc., and pertaining to research done at the Department of Computer Science / Department of Science Teaching at the University of Copenhagen.

### DISCLAIMER

- Texts are still hard-coded at this point.
- `form-signals` are added to nodes/states sequentially.
- The `Markov-tabel`-section (with its probabilities) is to be given some (future) purpose.
