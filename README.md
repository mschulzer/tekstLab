# TxtLab/ Folkeeventyr og -viser

### ABOUT THE PROJECT

The purpose of this rather simple webapp is to enable students (in L1) to work computationally/algorithmically with the analysis of folktales, but in ways underpinned theoretically by the work of early Formalists like Propp, Greimas, etc.

### DISCLAIMER

- Texts are still hard-coded at this point.
- `form-signals` are added to nodes/states sequentially.
- The `Markov-tabel`-section (with its probabilities) is to be given some (future) purpose.
